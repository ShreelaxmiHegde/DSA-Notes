## 🔹 2. In General Questions (Beyond Sliding Window)

### ✅ Easy (Straightforward Application of Concept)

* Usually direct implementation of **basic DSA** (stack, queue, hashmap, sorting).
* Flow: “Read problem → translate literally into code.”
* Examples: Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, Move Zeroes.
* Key Challenge: Edge cases.

---

### ⚖️ Medium (Pattern Recognition + One Optimization)

* Requires you to identify a **technique** (two pointers, sliding window, binary search, recursion with memoization).
* Flow: “Translate problem → spot the right pattern → apply template.”
* Examples: Binary Search on Answer problems, DP on strings, Medium-level sliding window.
* Key Challenge: You need to balance correctness + efficiency.

---

### 🔥 Hard (Multiple Patterns Combined)

* Problems that combine **two or more ideas**:

  * DP + Binary Search
  * Sliding Window + Deque
  * Graph + Heap
* Flow: “Break problem into subproblems → combine techniques → ensure optimization.”
* Examples: Minimum Window Substring, Trapping Rain Water, Hard DP (Edit Distance, Word Break II).
* Key Challenge: Managing multiple states, ensuring O(n) or O(n log n) solution, not brute force.

## 🎯 Interview Takeaway

* **Easy**: Your job → don’t overcomplicate. Show clean, bug-free code.
* **Medium**: Show you recognize patterns (sliding window, DP, binary search). Interviewers want to see if you *connect problems*.
* **Hard**: They test your problem-solving stamina → can you break down complex constraints into known techniques?
